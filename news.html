                <h2>Why Rabies is Deadly for Both Humans and Dogs</h2>
                <p>Rabies is a viral disease that affects the central nervous system, causing inflammation in the brain. Once symptoms appear, rabies is almost always fatal. In dogs, rabies can lead to severe behavioral changes, aggression, and eventual death. For humans, contracting rabies from a dog bite or scratch can be lethal if not treated immediately with post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).</p>

                <h2>Why Vaccinating Your Dog is Important</h2>
                <p>Vaccination is crucial for preventing many infectious diseases in dogs, including rabies, distemper, and parvovirus. Vaccines stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies, providing protection against specific infections. Regular vaccination not only keeps your dog healthy but also prevents the spread of diseases to other animals and humans.</p>
